    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>In medium bowl, combine ingredients and stir thoroughly (batter will be thick and sticky)</li>
        <li>Using a tablespoon, drop batter onto baking sheets lined with parchment and flatten slightly with spoon (biscuits will spread very little so they should be close together)</li>
        <li>Bake until lightly golden brown (usually 12-14 minutes)</li>
        <li>Cool completely on wire racks and store in refrigerator or freezer for longer (thaw before feeding)</li>
