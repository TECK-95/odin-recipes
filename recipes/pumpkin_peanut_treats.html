    <p>Much like people, dogs sometimes get a bit of a sweet tooth. These pumpkin and peanut butter treats are the perfect thing in that case. Your dog is almost sure to love the taste and texture of peanut butter, and a bit of pumpkin on top of that will bring out the flavour all the more. Pumpkin also helps settle the stomach, so there's that added benefit as well!</p>
