    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Much like people, dogs sometimes get a bit of a sweet tooth. These pumpkin and peanut butter treats are the perfect thing in that case. Your dog is almost sure to love the taste and texture of peanut butter, and a bit of pumpkin on top of that will bring out the flavour all the more. Pumpkin also helps settle the stomach, so there's that added benefit as well!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or more, if necessary for batter texture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Ingredients are for roughly 25 treats. Will need to be adjusted depending on batch size.</p>
